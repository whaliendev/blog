The following is configuration guide excerpted from the theme's [README](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini/README.md).

## 2. Getting started

After installing the theme successfully it requires a just a few more steps to get your site running.


### 2.1 The config file

Take a look inside the [`exampleSite`](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini/tree/master/exampleSite) folder of this theme. You'll find a file called [`config.yaml`](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini/blob/master/exampleSite/config.yaml). To use it, copy the [`config.yaml`](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini/blob/master/exampleSite/config.yaml) in the root folder of your Hugo site. Feel free to change the strings in this theme.

```bash
